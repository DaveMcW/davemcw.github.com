## Professional Self-Assessment ##

My coursework at SNHU has helped me develop diverse skills in the field of computer science. These include universal skills such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software/database design, and security. They also include specific skills, such as these computer languages:
- C (CS-405, CS-410)
- C++ (CS-260, CS-330, CS-405)
- Java (IT-145, IT-365, CS-250, CS-320, CS-360)
- OpenGL (CS-330)
- Python (MAT 243, CS-200, CS-350)
- SQL (DAD-220)
- x86 Assembly (CS-410)

I have experience using Git to track my own code, as well as collaborate with team members. I have worked on distributed projects using Bitbucket (CS-310) and GitHub (CS-499). I know the principles of Agile development using Scrum (CS-250).

I know how to interview stakeholders and build user stories to ensure their requirements are met (CS-250). I have experience writing automated software tests, and know the value of using automated tests to update stakeholders on progress (CS-320).

I know the benefits and complexity of data structures such as array, linked list, hash table, and binary search tree (CS-260). I know how to evaluate the runtime of algorithms using big-O notation (CS-260).

I have experience using UML to analyze and design software systems (IT-315). I have experience with several types of databases, including MySQL (DAD-220), SQLite (CS-360), and MongoDB (CS-340).

I have experience identifying common security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, SQL injection, and uninitialized variables (CS 405). I practice defensive programming by validating all user generated input, and sanitizing all user generated output.

My portfolio is based on two artifacts. The first is my CS-360 final project, a standalone campsite locator Android app. The second is my CS-340 final project, a RESTful API written in Python with a MongoDB backend. In CS-499 I merged these two together, to create a web enabled mobile app for locating campsites. Because it uses an online database, users can collaborate to add new campsites and review them. This shows my ability to develop front-end and back-end applications, adding value both to individual users and also to a group of users, such as a company.

The portfolio has four parts:
- [Code Review](code_review.html): A video demo of the two artifacts, and a look at their source code. I also discuss my specific plans to enhance them.
- [Database Enhancement](algorithms_and_data_structures.html): Describes how I ported the database from SQLite to MongoDB.
- [Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement](algorithms_and_data_structures.html): Describes how I improved the security of the password hashing algorithm, and improved the efficiency of the location search.
- [Software Design and Engineering Enhancement](design_and_engineering.html): Describes how I upgraded the app to make remote API calls to the database, instead of local calls.
