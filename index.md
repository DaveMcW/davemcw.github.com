## Professional Self-Assessment ##

For your e-portfolio you will write a professional self-assessment. In it, you will reflect on the capstone and your
experience in the Computer Science program as a whole. Your professional self-assessment will serve as the formal introduction to your portfolio. You
will add it to the beginning of your portfolio for your final submission in Module Seven.

Employers often interview a number of technically qualified candidates, so you should try to emphasize aspects of your ePortfolio that set you apart as
well as illustrate your competence and employability. In addition, the professional self-assessment is an opportunity to showcase your superior
6computer science knowledge, skills, and expertise. Be sure that your professional self-assessment is well organized and thoughtful, and that it
effectively communicates your strengths in the field of computer science. This artifact might serve as a great first draft of a cover letter and can be
useful as you apply for jobs with your new degree. Take advantage of your instructor feedback for this reason.

Include the following in your professional self-assessment:
A. Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped showcased your strengths and
shape your professional goals and values and prepared you to either enter or become more employable in the computer science field. Use
specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio. Please address following topics:
collaborating in a team environment, communicating to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database,
and security. Note: This should function as an overall introduction to your skills and you will become more specific relative to the included
artifacts in the next section.

B. Summarize/introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole; this will help demonstrate the full range of your
computer science talents and abilities? This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that will follow the professional
self-assessment.
